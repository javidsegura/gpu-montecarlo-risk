TL;DR: one CUDA thread per trial 

Metrics for nvidia nsight:
      - Get standard results, then write something 

Metrics with perf:
      - throughput -- not from perf
      - speedup (based on M time it took to solve it) -- not from perf
      - something with MPI (iterate back and forth with data anlysis results)
