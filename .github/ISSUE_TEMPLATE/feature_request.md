## Feature Description
A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see implemented.

## Problem Statement
What problem does this feature solve? Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

## Proposed Solution
Describe the solution you'd like to see implemented.

## Implementation Details
### Technical Approach
- [ ] **MPI**: Parallelization across nodes
- [ ] **OpenMP**: Thread-level parallelism
- [ ] **CUDA**: GPU acceleration
- [ ] **Hybrid**: Combination of above

### Performance Considerations
- **Expected Speedup**: [e.g., 2x, 10x, 100x]
- **Memory Requirements**: [e.g., additional GPU memory needed]
- **Scalability**: [e.g., how it scales with number of processes/threads]

### Security/Financial Domain
- **Monte Carlo Method**: [e.g., Variance reduction, Quasi-random numbers]
- **Security Type**: [e.g., Options, Bonds, Complex derivatives]
- **Risk Metrics**: [e.g., VaR, Expected Shortfall, Greeks]
